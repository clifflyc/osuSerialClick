# osuSerialClick

For people who want to build a custum keypad for osu!
This program makes up for the Arduino(uno)'s lack of keyboard abilities.

It is a very basic program that connects to a serial port, reads chars from the ports and then sends (when appropriate) keyboard input signals to press/release the z/x keys.

The config file ("click config".txt) should be in the same directory as build.
